## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JS
- API

### What I learned

In css I revised the concept of :root, and the usage of shadow boxes, and how to vertically center a div
in js i learned the usage of addEventListener

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
:root {
  --LightCyan: hsl(193, 38%, 86%);
  --NeonGreen: hsl(150, 100%, 66%);
  --GrayishBlue: hsl(217, 19%, 38%);
  --DarkGrayishBlue: hsl(217, 19%, 24%);
  --DarkBlue: hsl(218, 23%, 16%);
}
```

```css
div {
  margin: auto;
  position: relative;
  top: 50%;
  transform: translateY(50%);
}
```

```js
rollDice.addEventListener("click", setQuery);
```

### Continued development

As for future development, I would like to advance the speed of the project, and make the project pre-load an advice, and make better shadow box
