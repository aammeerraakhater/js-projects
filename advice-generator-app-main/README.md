## Overview

In this project I practice APIs and Json, and use html, css, js.

### The challenge

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JS
- API

### What I learned

In css I revised the concept of :root, and the usage of shadow boxes, and how to vertically center a div
in js i learned the usage of addEventListener

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

1. :root in CSS:
   - Use meaningful variable names and comment your code to improve readability.
   - Group related variables together to make it easier to manage and maintain.
   - Avoid using excessive global variables and prefer scoping variables to specific components or sections of your CSS.

```css
:root {
  --LightCyan: hsl(193, 38%, 86%);
  --NeonGreen: hsl(150, 100%, 66%);
  --GrayishBlue: hsl(217, 19%, 38%);
  --DarkGrayishBlue: hsl(217, 19%, 24%);
  --DarkBlue: hsl(218, 23%, 16%);
}
```

```css
div {
  margin: auto;
  position: relative;
  top: 50%;
  transform: translateY(50%);
}
```

2. Using addEventListener in JavaScript:
   - Use descriptive event names and function names to improve code readability.
   - Consider using event delegation to handle events on multiple elements efficiently.
   - Use the addEventListener method to attach events instead of inline event handlers.

```js
rollDice.addEventListener("click", setQuery);
```

### Continued development

As for future development, I would like to advance the speed of the project, and make the project pre-load an advice, and make better shadow box
